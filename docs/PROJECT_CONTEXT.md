# Project Context

This project builds an epigenetic-context-aware GNN framework for CRISPR-Cas9 off-target prediction.

The first working dataset is the Mak et al. 2022 crisprSQL-derived epigenetic/nucleosome dataset. Large data files live outside git under `data/raw/`, `data/interim/`, or `data/processed/`.

Sprint 0 initializes a reproducible, uv-based repository. It does not implement real ML models. The near-term path is dataset audit, label scheme validation, non-GNN baselines, graph construction, then GCN/GAT experiments.

Core rules:

- Use `uv` with `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`.
- Keep Colab as a command runner.
- Put reusable logic in `src/crispr_gnn/`.
- Keep notebooks exploratory or runner-only.
- Use guide-level evaluation for final results.
- Treat random splits as debug-only.
